# Treehouse Python Techdegree Project 5
## Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

### Project Description
This is a portfolio web application! The app lets the user add projects or edit the projects in their portfolio. These are all stored in a SQLite database. 

The HTML and CSS files were supplied by Treehouse.

### What I learned
- How to use Python for web development, which is exactly what I wanted to learn!
- How to use Python and SQLite together (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLAlchemy)
- How to best store portfolio-related data in a database that is clean and easy to access
- Using Python within template files (Jinja!) to use dynamic data
- How to use Flask to create different routes to send site visitors in the right direction (including 404 pages)
- Using PEP8 Guidelines to the fullest to keep my code beautiful!
