        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a highly technical Graphic Designer, Web Designer and Developer with a passion for creating design and web solutions in-house and for clients that reflect this technological age. For over 5 years, I’ve been helping clients and businesses with their branding, company collateral, advertising solutions and visual content. I also design and develop results-driven websites that promote sales and visits for my clients.</p>

        <p>My modern technology driven workflow sets me apart from traditional Designers, as I subscribe to new technologies, utilising macros, scripts, commands, and programming fundamentals to maximise workflow.</p>

        <p>When I’m not on the job, I love attending dance and gymnastic classes, learning new skills through online courses, and experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
